Tasks
------
1.  Naar nieuwe git repo **done**
2.  Date issue (see bday at issue 18)
3.  org issue -> kijkt mathijs nog naar **done (orgname and org unit were fine right?)**
4.  ge√Ønternationaliseerde (zie Django docs) verbose_name geeft **done**
5.  django-extensions graph_models **done**
6.  admin interface **done**
7.  inline admin for many (one right?) tomany **done**
8.  view in admin voor uploaden vcard **done**
9.  AGPL
10. Finish setup **done**
    opzet file, moet nog testen, admin houd ik ook nog geen rekening mee 
11. README.rst (reStructuredText) **done**
12. convertTo  **done**
    gedaan als importFrom and exportTo
13. gitignore **done**
14. pep8 **done? will probably have issues again, will look at it tomorrow** 
    gebruikte commando om whitespace om id's toe te staan;
    `pep8 -r --count --ignore=E201,E202,E221,E251 django_vcard.py`
15. Remove application files in root directory (`manage.py`, `urls.py`, `templates`, `*.pyc`, etc.) **done**
16. Unittests from `vcard/models.py` to `vcard/tests/__init__.py` **done**
17. Sensible data types for (at least):
    
    * URL (URLField) **done**
    * Timezone (int, I believe - see what vobject returns) Can be any value, even 'amsterdam' so just used charfield  **done**
    * Photo, Sound, Logo (blob/binary field?) Can be both file and uri with complex specs. Requires both consideration and more time; removed **done**
    * Note (TextField) **done**
    * Address, email and tel type (ChoiceField) You could use a choice field, but specs allow any value 
    * Geo (maybe Lat/lon. - otherwise leave as a string) **done** (left as string, specs are complex)
    * Email (EmailField) **done**
    * Bday (DateField) DateField does not comply to the specs of vcard; "koninginnedag" is a legal value **done**
    * Rev (Integer, maybe? used datefield) **done** BUT could lead to issues; rev is a timestamp but multiple formats exist 
18. Docstrings for at least all the models, and some of the main functions. **done**
    From the docstring the following things should roughly be clear:
    
    1. What does the function do (semantically, not algorithmically)
       
       Something like: "It eats bananas." 
       
       NOT: "It uses enzymes do digest such and such carbonhydrates etc. etc."
    2. What does it return (if it returns anything at all).
    3. What the meaning of eventual parameters are, especially if they're not
       downright evident.
19. Button in the admin contact view for uploading contacts.
20. The admin upload functionality should look like it's part of the admin.
    See: https://github.com/dokterbob/django-newsletter/tree/master/newsletter/templates/admin/newsletter/subscription
21. There is a bug causing a DatabaseError with SQLite due to some string data **done** (by removing photo sound and logo)
    being saved to the database as 8-bit bytestrings instead of unicode data
    (or blobs/binary data, what it probably should be).
22. If a fatal error should be raised during the import process, the imported **done**
    data should automatically be deleted from the database so we won't get
    invalid or incomplete data in the database upon repeated failures.
23. URL's get imported wrongfully from Apple's Address Book vCards:     
    `http://www.test.com` becomes `http\://www.test.com`
24. Limit choices for phone, email and address `type` fields to sensible 
    values (this does not limit the database, though).
    
    From http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard:
    The following lists are informative. See RFC2426 sections 3.2.1 ADR, 3.3.1 TEL, and 3.3.2 EMAIL respectively for normative type values. They are repeated here for convenience. Default type subproperty value(s) is(are) first in each list and indicated in ALL CAPS. types may be multivalued.

    * adr type: INTL, POSTAL, PARCEL, WORK, dom, home, pref
    * tel type: VOICE, home, msg, work, pref, fax, cell, video, pager, bbs, modem, car, isdn, pcs
    * email type: INTERNET, x400, pref
25. Make sure the unittest does an import - export - import for each of the **done**
    included test vCards.
26. Birthday INVOERVELD zou in IEDER geval een datumselectie moeten zijn. **done**
    Vervolgens zou je even moeten kijken hoe je kan zorgen dat dat in het 
    goede formaat als CharField wordt weggeschreven. (Hint: maak een widget
     aan.)
27. There's a value field with addresses, for some reason. Not anymore **done**
28. Fields like 'sort string', 'unique identifier' and 'last revision' will
    rarely ever be set by the user. In some of these cases it makes no sense
    to display them at all - in other cases they should merely render as read-
    only fields. Furthermore, the values of some of these fields should be 
    automatically set to default values from within the admin class.
29. Considering the structure of the admin interface, it seems to make more
    sense that the name should be part of the Contact model, rather than
    having a one-to-one relation with it.
30. For some fields, eg. 'Class', it is not clear what they mean. In these
    cases, either add some help_text explaining their meaning or leave the
    fields out of the Admin form.
31. For some reason a lot of verbose_name's seem to have capitals on every
    word. This is not necessary and makes it more difficult to add
     translations.
32. For a lot of fields, it makes sense to have a default ordering of fields.
    Perhaps it is best to either change the order of fields in the model
     and/or to specify the form field ordering using `fields` in the admin
     class or a custom ModelForm subclass.
33. A lot of fields seem to have a 'Data' property - which does not make a lot
    of sense. Perhaps something like 'Value' would make more sense from the UI
    side.

As some of the last few points might involve extra work, it makes sense to discuss the possibilities of adding a few hours to the original statement.
